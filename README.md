# Data Science and Visualization

Welcome to my repository of some of the completed assignments from Data Science I, Data Science II, and Data Visualization & Visual Analytics â€” courses from the Master of Business Analytics (MBAN) program at the Schulich School of Business, York University.

These graduate-level courses provided a comprehensive foundation in data science and visual analytics. The assignments demonstrate practical applications of statistical analysis, machine learning, data engineering, business problem-solving, and visual communication using tools such as Python and Tableau.

Data Science I focused on core concepts and techniques for analyzing data-centered business problems, including data exploration, statistical testing, and supervised learning models.

Data Science II extended into advanced topics, including Python scripting and modeling techniques like ensemble methods, unsupervised learning, and time series analysis etc.

Visual Analytics introduced theories of visual communication design, data-driven decision-making workflows, and best practices in storytelling, with technical training in Tableau and an emphasis on visualization taxonomy and structure.

This repository serves as a personal portfolio of my coursework and hands-on learning, highlighting the progression of technical and analytical skills developed throughout the program.
