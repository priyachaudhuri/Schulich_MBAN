Welcome to my repository of completed assignments from the Data Science I and Data Science II courses, part of the Master of Business Analytics (MBAN) program at the Schulich School of Business, York University.

These two graduate-level courses provide a comprehensive introduction to data science from both foundational and advanced perspectives. The assignments demonstrate practical applications of statistical analysis, machine learning, data engineering, and business problem-solving using Python and associated technologies.

This repository serves as a personal portfolio of my coursework and hands-on learning in data science, highlighting the progression of technical and analytical skills developed throughout the program.
